#Hello! 
Welcome to my Repository!
My name is Daniel Lee and I am in Ashwin's CSC 3320 class.
This is going to be a glimpse of my code along with what seems to symbolize a manual for executing the files that you are going to find located within the folders or just out and about.
It was all written for this class (CSC 3320) throughout the semester. 
Code with the C extension(s) hence: ".c" will be executable via "./" followed by the file name.
The shell script files will also be executable by using this command. 
Although, the text files that yield the ".txt" extension will only be files that are meant to be read by the user(s).
If there are any complications with executions or questions, feel free to reach out to me at jaesongschoolthings@gmail.com or jaesongleehou@gmail.com and I will be more than happy to assist you in moving forward with what you are trying to achieve.
Thank you.
